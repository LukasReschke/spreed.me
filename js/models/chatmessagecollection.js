	 * Collection for chat messages.
	 *
	 * The ChatMessageCollection gives read access to all the chat messages from
	 * a specific chat room. The room token must be provided in the constructor
	 * options (as "token"), either as an actual room token or as null. It is
	 * possible to change the room of a ChatMessageCollection at any time by
	 * calling "setRoomToken". In any case, although null is supported as a
	 * temporal or reset value, note that an actual room token must be set
	 * before synchronizing the collection.
	 *
	 * "read" is the only synchronization method allowed; chat messages can not
	 * be edited nor deleted, and to send a new message a standalone ChatMessage
	 * should be used instead.
	 *
	 * To get the messages from the server "receiveMessages" should be used. It
	 * will enable polling to the server and automatically update the collection
	 * when new messages are received. Once enabled, the polling will go on
	 * indefinitely. Due to this "stopReceivingMessages" must be called once
	 * the ChatMessageCollection is no longer needed.

			// be lower than the model id of the oldest one). If another group
			// of messages were received now then the newest message would be
			// added to the collection after the oldest message from the
			// previous group. Therefore, the models in the collection would not
			// follow an absolute order from the newest message to the oldest
			// one, but a local order for each group of messages fetched.
			//
			// Just sorting the collection is not a solution either. Setting
			// "sort: true" as a fetch option would keep the collection sorted
			// (although the ids of the models would still have the same problem
			// described above), but the "add" events would be triggered anyway
			// in the original order of the messages passed to "set".

			// messages sorted from oldest to newest, is to sort the models
			// passed to "set" from oldest to newest.
