# Nextcloud Talk

**Video- & audio-conferencing app for Nextcloud**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/spreed/master/docs/spreed-in-action.png)

## Why is this so awesome?

* :busts_in_silhouette: **Private, group, public and password protected calls!** Just invite somebody, a whole group or send a public link to invite to a call.
* :computer: **Screen sharing!** Share your screen with participants of your call. You just need to use Firefox version 52 (or newer) or Chrome with this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screensharing-for-nextclo/kepnpjhambipllfmgmbapncekcmabkol).
* :rocket: **Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Contacts and users – more to come.
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [simpleWebRTC](https://simplewebrtc.com/) library.

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/milestones/):
* :speech_balloon: [Chat integration](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/35)
* :raising_hand: [Federated calls](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/21), to call people on other Nextclouds

If you have suggestions or problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues) or contribute directly :)

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
